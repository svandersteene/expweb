# Experimental Web

Fly through space and shoot the meteorites coming towards you to collect points.
Each level gets harder and harder as there are more and faster meteorites.
And hey, don't miss any.. Because the more meteorites you miss, the less accurate your bullets get!

## Brief

Create a web application using a known technology (WebGL, **three.js**, WebSocket, WebRTC) in combination with a unknown technology from the list underneath.
Since it's an experimental use case, there is no minimum required browserversion.

**Unknown technolgies**

-   Deep Learning / Machine Learning (vb. tensorflow js, ml5js, Jeeliz)
-   Shape Detection API en/of Posenet
-   Web Bluetooth API
-   **Gamepad API**

## Technical specifications

* Run `yarn install` to get started
* Gamepad API browser support: Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari 10.1+
* The game uses AFrame, a framework based on three.js
